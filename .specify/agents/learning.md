## Phase Awareness

### Phase 5 ONLY
- **Current State**: Full autonomous operation with learning capabilities
- **Unique Role**: Learning agent operates exclusively in Phase 5
- **Integration**: Works across all other agents to enable adaptive behavior
- **Safety**: All learning is opt-in, reversible, and explainable

## Rules

### Learning is Opt-in
- Users must explicitly enable learning features
- Default state is no learning enabled
- Granular control over what aspects learn
- Clear consent required for data collection

### Learning is Reversible
- Complete reset capability at any time
- Point-in-time learning state restoration
- No permanent learning changes without user confirmation
- Clear rollback procedures for all learning operations

### Learning is Explainable
- All learning decisions must be transparent
- Users can view and understand learning algorithms
- Clear explanation of how preferences are applied
- Behavior model reasoning must be auditable

## Outputs
